# TODO:
- [x] Convert the entire server to use typescript and express. This will save time over time
- [ ] Add an API for adding and removing tracked curseforge packages
- [ ] Make a CLI program to interface with said API
- [ ] Make a feature where said CLI program can crawl curseforge
- [ ] Make this server also host non-curseforge packages (this will effectively convert this into a normal repository)
- [ ] Make a web-based interface to add new mods and releases (preferably with some user authentication)
